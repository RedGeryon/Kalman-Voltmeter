# Kalman_Voltmeter
1D Kalman implementation study (voltmeter sample problem)

This is a study in Kalman filter implementation. We are modeling how kalman filtering can help smooth out noisy measurements from a voltmeter that is measuring (what we know/designate) as a constant voltage source. The simplicity of the system helps us understand how to define and apply various matrices to a static system.
